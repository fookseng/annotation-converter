## Quick start

*The annotations are created using [labelme](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme).

*Both images and annotations(.json) are place in the same folder named,'resources'.

Run the `labelme2coco.py` script to generate a COCO data formatted JSON file for you.
```
python labelme2coco.py resources
```
*The output will be trainval.json.
